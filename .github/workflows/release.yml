          A native macOS Quick Look extension for YAML files.
          
          ### Installation
          1. Download `yamlQuickLook.zip`
          2. Unzip and move `YamlQuickLook.app` to `/Applications`
          3. Open the app once to register the extension
          4. Enable the extension in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Extensions > Quick Look
          
          ### Important Note
          This release is **not code-signed or notarized**. 
          macOS Sequoia and later make it (rightly so) very difficult to open unsigned apps.
          
          You **must** remove the quarantine attribute after installation:
          ```bash
          xattr -cr /Applications/YamlQuickLook.app
          ```
          
          Then restart Finder and QuickLook:
          ```bash
          killall Finder
          qlmanage -r && qlmanage -r cache
          ```
          
          ### Building with Code Signing and Notarization
          
          If you want to build a properly signed and notarized version:
          
          1. **Set up your Apple Developer credentials:**
             - Enroll in the Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
             - Create an App ID in your Apple Developer account
             - Create an app-specific password for notarization at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)
          
          2. **Build with code signing:**
             ```bash
             xcodebuild -scheme YamlQuickLook \
               -configuration Release \
               DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
               CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
               clean build
             ```
          
          3. **Notarize the app:**
             ```bash
             # Create a zip for notarization
             ditto -c -k --keepParent YamlQuickLook.app YamlQuickLook.zip
             
             # Submit for notarization
             xcrun notarytool submit YamlQuickLook.zip \
               --apple-id "your@email.com" \
               --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
               --password "app-specific-password" \
               --wait
             
             # Staple the notarization ticket
             xcrun stapler staple YamlQuickLook.app
             ```
          
          4. **Verify:**
             ```bash
             spctl -a -vvv -t install YamlQuickLook.app
             ```
