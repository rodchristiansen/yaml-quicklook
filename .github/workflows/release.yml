          A native macOS Quick Look extension for YAML files.
          
          ### Installation
          1. Download `yamlQuickLook.zip`
          2. Unzip and move `YamlQuickLook.app` to `/Applications`
          3. Open the app once to register the extension
          4. Enable the extension in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Extensions > Quick Look
          
          ### Important Note
          This release is **not code-signed or notarized**. macOS Sequoia and later make it difficult to open unsigned apps.
          
          You **must** remove the quarantine attribute after installation:
          ```bash
          xattr -cr /Applications/YamlQuickLook.app
          ```
          
          Then restart Finder and QuickLook:
          ```bash
          killall Finder
          qlmanage -r && qlmanage -r cache
          ```
